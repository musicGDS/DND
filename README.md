The character has a name and these stats:
Strength (STR), 
Dexterity (DEX), 
Constitution (CON), 
Intelligence (INT),

The program menu asks for numeric user input for 3 menu choices:

2 - Create character manually
3 - Show saved characters

1 - Create a random character. Create a character with a random name and stats values and prints it in the console.
2 - Create a character manually. Lets user to create a character manually by entering prompted values.
3 - Show saved characters. Prints stored characters names and numbers. User must enter a character number to get its stats in the console.

After each step is finished the program returns to the main menu and waits for the user input.
